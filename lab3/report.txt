Difficulties:
Many. We could not get github to work at first because each of us had made the SSH key on his own laptop. Then, we had quite a bit of
trouble just understanding what was going on, before figuring that out. Next, we were initializing the LEDs incorrectly in three
different ways, before finally we got the hint to use a bitwise or to initialize them all. After that, we had trouble getting the button
to pause the cycle of lights. For a long time, we had it so that a button press would stop the lights from cycling, but the loop would
continue. So youâ€™d pause on the North light and end up on the South light after letting go of the button. Eventually we figured out that
we needed to keep the i in the for loop from incrementing during pause time, and now it works as intended.
